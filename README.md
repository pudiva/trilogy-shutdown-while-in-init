Trilogy SSL Error: shutdown while in init
=========================================

This is an attempt to reproduce the "shutdown while in init" bug by running MySQL on Debian Stretch and clients on Ubuntu Focal.

So far, I wasn't able to reproduce it.

Wanna try yourself? Install docker, docker-compose and run:
```sh
make test
```
